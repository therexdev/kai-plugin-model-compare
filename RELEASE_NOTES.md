# 0.3.0 — Independent Foundation plugin

Requires KAI Foundation 0.7.0 and plugin API 3. The plugin now ships and owns its native feature engine, interface, assets, state and dependencies. Core exposes documented shared services instead of private feature controllers.

This is a fresh-profile architecture. It does not import or delete original-app documents, accounts or settings. Installation explicitly requires trust in native code with full computer and application access. The interface remains sandboxed.

Feature state is stored separately under the plugin's Foundation data directory. Existing interface controls and feature workflows remain available.
